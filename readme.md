## Project Motivation

Airbnb, a home sharing business model that is new and has rapidly been growing in the US and all over the world. However they are not so popular in Japan where I live. This may be due to communication capability and their shy character. Therefore, it is my interest to understand how it has been growing in the world, what is current status and are there any issues etc.

1. What are the trends of the growth of business development and situation ?
2. What is the value of a guest ?
3. what is the trend of the price ?
4. Why are they not popular in Japan ?
